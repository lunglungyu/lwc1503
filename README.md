To Do List:
==============================

- Dual direction GCs
  - try autocorrelation between those Timeseries
  
- Direct GC vs Indirect GC
  - e.g. a triangle in a directed graph
  
- Station-pair-wise GC relation
  - clear GC relation?
  - geometry?
  
- Sometimes only have long range GCs, no GC with closer stations
